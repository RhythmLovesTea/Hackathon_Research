## ðŸ’¡ Solution

We propose a **two-layered dashboard** that works like  
**Google Maps + Air Traffic Control for space.**

---

### 1. Public Dashboard (Open View)
- **Orbital Highways & Congestion** â†’ Simple visuals of LEO, MEO, GEO zones.  
- **Debris Density Maps** â†’ Where risks are highest.  
- **Educational Animations** â†’ Show how collisions cascade (Kessler Syndrome).  
- **Awareness Layer** â†’ Helps the public, students, and startups understand orbital safety.  

---

### 2. Agency/Partner Dashboard (Secure View)
- **Federated Data Sharing** â†’ Agencies can upload tracking data securely + anonymously.  
- **High-Accuracy Conjunction Analysis** â†’ Tools for predicting potential collisions.  
- **Collaboration Features** â†’ Agencies, companies, and policymakers work from the same interface.  
- **Controlled Access** â†’ Sensitive details (like military satellites) remain private.

### 3. Unique Strengths of Our Approach
- **Federated Collaboration** â†’ Neutral platform where data can be shared without exposing classified information.  
- **Unified Visualization** â†’ A single, intuitive interface for specialists *and* non-specialists.  
- **Traffic Flow Analogy** â†’ Transforms raw orbital elements into highways, congestion zones, and risk maps.  
- **Open + Extendable** â†’ The visualization framework is open-source; secure data channels are permissioned.

ðŸ‘‰ In short:  
Our solution bridges the gap between **fragmented technical systems** and the need for an **intuitive, collaborative, and secure platform** for orbital traffic management.

## ❗ Problem Statement

Space is getting crowded.  
Agencies like **NASA, ESA, and ISRO** already track debris using radar and telescope networks, but the real problem is not *tracking* — it’s **fragmentation and accessibility**:

- **Data Silos** → Each agency collects its own tracking data, but sharing is limited and politically sensitive.  
- **No Common Operating Picture** → There’s no single dashboard where everyone can see orbital traffic together (like “Google Maps of space”).  
- **Too Technical** → Current data formats (e.g., TLEs) are highly mathematical, useful only for aerospace engineers.  
- **Limited Access** → Policymakers, startups, and researchers don’t have easy tools to understand orbital congestion.  
- **Trust Gap** → Because systems are tied to national security, there’s no neutral, collaborative platform.  

As a result, **collision prevention is fragmented**, awareness is low, and commercial players cannot easily contribute to safer space operations.  

👉 The world urgently needs a **neutral, intuitive, and collaborative way** to visualize and manage orbital traffic.

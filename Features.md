## ✨ Features

Our Space Debris Dashboard includes the following key features:

---

### 🌍 Public Dashboard (Awareness Layer)
- **Interactive Orbital Map** → Explore LEO, MEO, and GEO zones in a “Google Maps” style view.  
- **Debris Density Visualization** → Heatmaps showing congested orbital regions.  
- **Educational Animations** → Explains how debris spreads (Kessler Syndrome) and risks of collisions.  
- **Live Statistics** → Approximate number of active satellites and debris objects in each zone.  
- **Open Access** → Designed for students, researchers, startups, and the general public.  

---

### 🛰️ Agency & Partner Dashboard (Secure Layer)
- **Federated Data Sharing** → Agencies upload tracking data securely and anonymously.  
- **Collision Prediction Tools** → High-accuracy conjunction analysis for real-time risk assessment.  
- **Shared Operating Picture** → A unified view for agencies, companies, and policymakers.  
- **Role-Based Access Control** → Sensitive details (e.g., military satellites) remain hidden while still enabling cooperation.  
- **Data Trust Layer** → Cryptographic methods to ensure authenticity without revealing classified sources.  

---

### 🧠 Intelligence & Extensions
- **AI-based Risk Forecasting** → Machine learning models to predict debris hotspots.  
- **Orbit Optimization** → Suggests safer orbital paths for satellites to reduce collision risks.  
- **Debris Removal Simulation** → Models how cleanup missions (lasers, nets, robotic arms) could reduce congestion.  
- **Scalable Framework** → Open-source visualization layer that allows universities, startups, and researchers to add new modules.

### 🎛️ Design Philosophy
- **Simple for Non-Specialists** → A policymaker or student can understand orbital traffic at a glance.  
- **Powerful for Experts** → Agencies get technical depth for analysis and collaboration.  
- **Neutral & Transparent** → Open-source visualization ensures trust; sensitive data stays protected.

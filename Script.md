## 🎬 Slide 1 — Idea Title & Opening Hook (0:00–0:45)

**Visuals**:  
- Big single question in large font.  
- Single image (satellite + heatmap or collision animation).  
- Subtitle with team name.  

**Title**:  
> *“What if the sky that connects your phone, hospital, and bank becomes too crowded to work?” or ashutosh you can also give the river example*  

**Sub-title**:  
> *“A Public + Operational Space Debris Dashboard”*  

**Script (say exactly):**  
“Good morning — quick question: what happens the day our navigation, weather, and communications networks stop being reliable because of debris? You wouldn’t see it coming — no traffic lights, no weather warnings, no reliable remote connectivity. Today we present a practical solution that prevents that outcome: an all-orbit, shared space-debris dashboard that turns coded tracking feeds into live, actionable decisions for agencies — and transparent awareness for the public.”

**One-sentence purpose (say):**  
“Our dashboard gives operators the same situational advantage that air-traffic controllers have — and gives citizens a flight-radar for space.”

## 🛰️ Slide 2 — Technical Approach: Flowchart Explained (0:45–3:45)

**Visuals**:  
- Flowchart with boxes.  
- Highlight each box as you speak.  

**Script (walk left to right):**

1. **Data Ingestion (15–20s):**  
“We ingest all available feeds: standard public TLE catalogs (Space-Track, Celestrak), commercial radar feeds (LeoLabs/COMSPOC if available), optical sensor reports, and any cooperative national feeds. In short: multiple inputs for redundancy and cross-validation.”  

2. **Orbit Simulation (30s):**  
“Ingested data goes into the orbit propagator. For TLEs we use SGP4 via Skyfield for fast propagation; for higher accuracy we incorporate Poliastro. We compute position, velocity and uncertainty (covariance) for each object.”  

3. **Collision Detection (30s):**  
“With propagated orbits we run conjunction assessment: miss-distance, probability of collision, and identify high-risk windows. Layered filtering reduces false positives. This is the analytic core: raw orbits become ranked alerts.”  

4. **Database Layer (20s):**  
“All results (TLEs, propagated states, CDMs, maneuvers) are stored in Postgres with PostGIS + Timescale. This provides reproducibility, audit trails, and fast spatio-temporal queries.”  

5. **Visualization & Decision Support (45s):**  
“This is the user face: an interactive 3D orbital map (CesiumJS), heatmaps of debris density, risk lanes, and conjunction cards. Features include:  
(a) 3D map with orbit trails  
(b) Density heatmaps  
(c) Alert panel with top-5 risks  
(d) Timeline slider to replay predicted events”  

6. **Maneuver Simulation (30s):**  
“From the dashboard you can run ‘what-if’ maneuvers: propose ∆v, simulate trajectories, recompute conjunctions, and show impact visually. The system suggests candidate maneuvers with estimated ∆v cost and updated probabilities.”  

7. **Feedback Loop (15s):**  
“Executed maneuvers, user feedback, and new sensor data are fed back into ingestion — improving predictions and reducing false positives.”  

**Demo cue (say):**  
“For the judges we’ll demo a simple case: ingest a live TLE, show a top-10 conjunction, propose a maneuver, and replay the before/after heatmap so you can see risk reduction in real time.”  

**Technical callouts (say as bullets):**  
- “Key libs: Skyfield/SGP4, Poliastro, PostgreSQL/PostGIS/Timescale, CesiumJS.”  
- “Security: RBAC, encrypted provable logs, data classification.”  
- “APIs: REST ingestion, WebSocket updates, CDM exports.”

## ⚙️ Slide 3 — Feasibility & Viability (3:45–5:45)

**Visuals**:  
- Left: Feasibility (stack, timeline).  
- Right: Viability (costs, agreements, business model).  

**Script:**  

**Feasibility:**  
- “Open tooling: mature open-source libs (Skyfield, Poliastro, CesiumJS).”  
- “Data availability: public TLE feeds + commercial radars.”  
- “Team skills: Python + JS + SQL stack, no exotic hardware.”  

**Viability:**  
- “MVP: demo-ready prototype with open TLEs.”  
- “Production costs: mainly commercial radar subscriptions + ops, shared across agencies.”  
- “Revenue models: agency hosting, premium integrations, licensed deployments, public/edu free tier.”  

**Risks & mitigation:**  
- “Data sensitivity → private instances with access controls.”  
- “Latency limits → fuse multiple sources, show confidence intervals.”

## 🌍 Slide 4 — Impact & Benefits (5:45–8:15)

**Visuals**:  
- Left: Operational benefits.  
- Right: Quantified savings + public impact.  

**Script:**  

**Operational Benefits (≈45s):**  
- “Faster decisions — one dashboard replaces red-alert emails.”  
- “Fewer false maneuvers — saving propellant and mission time.”  
- “Collaborative, auditable maneuvers — shared mission rooms.”  
- “Public transparency — trust and policy pressure for sustainability.”  

**Quantified Savings (≈60s):**  
- Baseline debris-related annual losses (LEO): **$90M**.  
- Dashboard reduces risk by 30% → **$27M saved/year**.  
- Avoided maneuver + downtime costs: **+$6M/year**.  
- Gross = **$33M saved/year**.  
- Minus platform cost (~$5M) = **Net $28M/year savings**.  
- “Even at half impact, benefits exceed costs.”  

**Public Benefits (≈30s):**  
- “Citizens benefit indirectly — satellites for GPS, weather, banking, comms stay online.”  
- “Public dashboard builds trust and empowers researchers, startups, and journalists.”

## 📚 Slide 5 — Research & References (8:15–9:45)

**Visuals**:  
- Logos (ESA, NASA, UNOOSA, LeoLabs, COMSPOC).  
- Short one-line evidence bullets.  

**Script (say each):**  
- “ESA reports — collision avoidance frequency and false alarm reduction potential.”  
- “Industry providers — LeoLabs and COMSPOC show real-time tracking models.”  
- “Economic analyses — LEO collision costs in tens of millions annually.”  
- “UNOOSA & GAO — calls for data-sharing and transparency.”  

(If pressed by judges):  
“We have all sources documented; everything is public and citable.”

## 🔑 Closing & Ask (9:45–10:00)

**Visuals**:  
- One line: *“Pilot access + mentorship = measurable collision risk reduction in months.”*  

**Script:**  
“In short: our dashboard is practical, built on mature tools, and addresses real operational and public gaps. For this project we request:  
1. Pilot data access or simulated datasets.  
2. Mentorship + seed credits to integrate a commercial radar feed.  

With that, we can show measurable collision-risk reduction in a live pilot within months.”

## 💡 Quick Judge Q&A Cheat-Sheet (keep handy)

- **How are you different from LeoLabs/COMSPOC?**  
“They are LEO-focused commercial trackers. We are all-orbit, multi-source, collaborative, and transparent.”  

- **Is the data accurate?**  
“We show uncertainty explicitly, fuse multiple sources, and make confidence visible to operators.”  

- **Biggest risk?**  
“Data-sharing agreements. Mitigated by private agency instances and an open demo with public datasets.”

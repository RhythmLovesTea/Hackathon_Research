# üöÄ Proposed All-Orbit Space Debris Dashboard for Space Agencies

---

## üìå Context & Problem

Spacecraft routinely suffer damage from even millimetre-sized debris.  
For example, **ESA‚Äôs Sentinel-1A** solar array was struck by a fragment under 5 mm, leaving a 40 cm crater.  

In today‚Äôs increasingly crowded space environment ‚Äì with **1.2M+ objects >1 cm orbiting Earth** ‚Äì agencies face severe challenges:

- **Disparate sensor networks** (radars, telescopes, lasers) and catalogs (e.g. US Space Force TLEs) ‚Üí fragmented coverage, esp. small debris & deep space.  
- **High data latency** ‚Üí Space-Track TLE catalog updates only ~40 times/day, causing orbit uncertainties.  
- **Excess false alarms** ‚Üí ESA reports ~40 close approaches per satellite/year in LEO, with most false positives.  
- **Operational bottlenecks** ‚Üí collision avoidance still relies on email & phone calls during ‚Äúred alerts.‚Äù  
- **Lack of standardization** ‚Üí agencies maintain siloed catalogs and formats, limiting coordination.  

**Summary**: Agencies suffer from **incomplete debris awareness, slow analytics, poor collaboration, high false-alarm rates, and non-transparent processes**.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Dashboard Features & How They Address Challenges

### 1. **Unified Data Integration**
- Aggregates multiple catalogs & sensors (radar, optical, TLEs, OEMs).  
- Fuses diverse sources to fill coverage gaps and improve orbit accuracy.  
- Enables cross-checking of US, European, and commercial SSA data (LeoLabs, COMSPOC).  

### 2. **Real-Time Interactive Visualization**
- Uses 3D engines (e.g. CesiumJS) to plot **all tracked objects across LEO, MEO, GEO**.  
- Provides live satellite & debris positions ‚Üí immediate awareness of dangerous conjunctions.  
- Extends existing LEO-only solutions (like LeoLabs) to all orbit regimes.  

### 3. **Collision Alerts & False-Alarm Filtering**
- Computes conjunction probabilities using improved orbit propagation.  
- Reduces false positives by combining multiple data streams & precision laser ranging.  
- Graphical alerts (risk corridors, heatmaps) for quick threat assessment.  

### 4. **Maneuver Simulation & Planning**
- ‚ÄúWhat-if‚Äù analysis for collision avoidance maneuvers.  
- Simulates orbit changes & shows new conjunction outcomes in real time.  
- Enables **multi-agency maneuver negotiation** (inspired by AMOS Concurrent Avoidance concept).  

### 5. **Cross-Agency Collaboration**
- Secure, shared interface for partner agencies.  
- Replaces manual report exchanges & siloed CDMs.  
- Web-based ‚Äúmission rooms‚Äù with synchronized visualizations & chats.  

### 6. **Public Transparency Portal**
- Optional non-sensitive public layer with interactive debris maps.  
- Promotes trust, compliance, and citizen awareness (as called for by ESA, UN, COPUOS).

## üìä Comparison to Existing SSA Solutions

| Feature / Platform   | ESA SST/SSA | COMSPOC (Cesium) | LeoLabs | **Proposed Dashboard** |
|----------------------|-------------|------------------|---------|-------------------------|
| **Orbit Coverage**   | LEO, limited MEO/GEO | LEO, MEO, GEO | LEO only | **All orbits (LEO, MEO, GEO, cislunar)** |
| **Data Sources**     | National sensors | Proprietary & partners | Proprietary radars | **Multi-source (TLE, GNSS, radar, optical)** |
| **Update Rate**      | Minutes‚Äìhours | Near real-time | Real-time (LEO only) | **Real-time continuous** |
| **Visualization**    | No public GUI | 3D real-time | 3D real-time (LEO only) | **Interactive 3D maps, timelines** |
| **Collision Alerts** | CDMs | Automated | Automated (LEO only) | **Integrated alerts + filtering** |
| **Maneuver Sim.**    | Manual | Limited/unclear | None | **Yes ‚Äì multi-vehicle what-if** |
| **Collaboration**    | Agency-only | Customers only | Customers only | **Multi-agency shared workspace** |
| **Public Access**    | Reports only | None | None | **Optional transparency portal** |

**Gap Filled**: Only the proposed dashboard offers **all-orbit coverage, real-time fusion, maneuver planning, collaboration, and transparency** in one unified platform.

- Preventing collisions avoids **$100M‚Äì$1B losses**.  
- Dashboard investment = small vs. massive cost avoidance.  

### ‚úÖ Improved Collaboration
- Aligns with UNOOSA & COPUOS guidelines.  
- Ensures compatible formats, real-time interoperability, and joint decision-making.  

### ‚úÖ Public Accountability
- Transparent, non-sensitive reporting builds trust.  
- Reduces geopolitical tensions, empowers researchers, and supports sustainability.

## üß© Conclusion

A **unified, all-orbit debris dashboard**:

- Directly mitigates **data fragmentation, latency, and coordination bottlenecks**.  
- Reduces **false alerts, unnecessary maneuvers, and operational costs**.  
- Improves **cross-agency workflows** and aligns with international sustainability goals.  
- Multiplies effectiveness of existing SSA investments and prevents costly collisions.  

As one expert notes: *‚ÄúEven passive improvements in conjunction data can inform maneuvers that would not have otherwise been made‚Äù* ‚Äì making spaceflight significantly safer.
